# LugNut
A single page static site generator using markdown. This is a simpler version of RKStatic. It doesn't support themes, but looks way better and is easier to use. Made for personal use.

# Use
Just run: ```python
python lugnut.py {markdown file path} {output html path}```

Example: ```python
python lugnut.py index.md index.html```

If you download and run the example command, it should generate a styled html file.
